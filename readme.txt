Adds OExchange support to WordPress' "Press This" bookmarklet (http://oexchange.org).

This plugin requires:

* the /.well-known/-plugin: http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/well-known/
* the host-meta-plugin: http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/host-meta/

Supported Plugins:

* the webfinger-plugin: http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/webfinger/

From the website:

This'll help you get up and running, whether you're a service that can accept content, a site  that has content to share, or a tool of some sort. Remember that OExchange isn't limited to "sharing" things; it applies to any case where one service wants to send URL-based content to another -- microblogging, translating, printing, whatever.
